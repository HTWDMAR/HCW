# Horizontal Collector Well (HCW)

The code computes drawndown using Hantush and Papadopulos (1962)[^1] equation.

Python v 3.9 or higher will be required to run the code. Besides Python libraries [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [scipy](https://scipy.org/) are required.

**To use code**:

1. Clone the repo 
2. Install the required Python libraries
3. Open the HCWSimulatorApp.py file in any IDE/terminal
4. run `streamlit run HCWSimulatorApp.py`


**Online App**

The equation can be more conviniently run using the [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app from the app website: [HCW Simulator App](https://hcw-simulator.streamlit.app/).
